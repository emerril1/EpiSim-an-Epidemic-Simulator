# Simidemic: An Epidemic Simulator

“Simidemic: An Epidemic Simulator” falls within the domain of epidemiology and computational modeling. Specifically, it focuses on simulating infectious disease spread within a controlled, virtual population to study dynamics of transmission and intervention strategies.

Understanding how infectious diseases spread and how intervention strategies can mitigate outbreaks is critical for public health planning not just locally, but globally. However, real-world experimentation is often impractical, unethical, or even highly unfeasible. Therefore, computational simulations are needed that model disease transmission, evaluate infection rates, and assess the effectiveness of intervention strategies in a controlled environment.

The simulation will:
* Model infection dynamics using a compartmental approach (e.g., susceptible, infected, recovered).
* Track infection rates over time.
* Evaluate the effectiveness of basic intervention strategies (e.g., isolation, vaccination).

The simulation will not:
* Differentiate between types of pathogens such as bacteria, parasites, or fungi.
* Model complex social, environmental, or biological factors beyond random interactions within the population.

By focusing on a simplified virus model, this simulation aims to provide insights into disease propagation and containment strategies, offering a foundation for understanding more complex epidemiological scenarios.
