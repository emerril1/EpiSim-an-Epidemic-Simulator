# Infectious-Disease-Spread-Modeling

The title of this simulation will be "Infectious Disease Spread Modeling". The goal of this project will be to model and simulate a real-world scenario of disease spread. In addition, infection rates and intervention strategies will be tracked to determine the effectiveness of artificial spread of the disease. 

Determining the effectiveness of disease spread and the strategies to prevent it will allow a better understanding of the real-life strategies used by scientists and physicians. Only a selected random disease will be simulated and it will only be a simple virus. 

This project does not aim to differentiate the effects between viruses, parasites, fungi, etc. Simulation will also be primarily focused on random spread and clear boundaries based on a compartmental model.
